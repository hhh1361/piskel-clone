### Description:  
An application for creating animations. The goal was to create a service similar to https://www.piskelapp.com/.  
In my application you can draw using various tools, create, copy, delete frames, adjust the animation frequency, save and continue sessions, export the results of your work.  
This was my first project, which wasn't written like spaghetti code in one index.js :)  
Therefore, the project structure is very poor. At that time, i had no understanding of how to divide the application into components, where to consolidate them, etc.
